Elm-conf is a new conference as of 2016. We want to promote Elm and the
ecosystem around it by bringing together the brightest minds in the community
for a day of mixing ideas and making connections.

Thank you to everyone who helped make elm-conf US a reality! Special thanks to
[Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com) for hosting the conference, to our
great [sponsors](/sponsor/) for making it affordable, and of course the talk
selection committee: [Jessica Kerr](https://twitter.com/jessitron) and
[Richard Feldman](https://twitter.com/rtfeldman). It wouldn't have been possible
without you!

## General organizing principles:

We assume you know about Elm already. Beginner talks, while great, are more
appropriate for a general-interest conference.

A thriving community is built on diversity. We encourage people from all
different backgrounds and walks of life to attend and speak. To ensure that all
are welcome, we follow and enforce a
[code of conduct](http://thestrangeloop.com/policies.html), to which all present
at the conference are expected to adhere.

Community, not marketing. We don't give the attendee list to any sponsors.

Blind auditions. Talks are selected anonymously by a diverse talk selection
committee.
