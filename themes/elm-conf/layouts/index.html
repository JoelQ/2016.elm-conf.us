        <p>
            elm-conf is a one-day conference focusing on the Elm programming
            language and its libraries, colocated with <a
                                                           href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/">StrangeLoop</a>. It aims to be a
            welcoming place for people worldwide to come together and learn about
            what is happening with the language and community, and to celebrate
            everything that makes Elm great.

            We are currently accepting <a href="">talk proposals</a>. The proposal

            {{.Site.Params.cfp_end}}, and tickets will go on sale after speakers are

        <h2>Call for Speakers</h2>
        <p>
            If it's your first time proposing a talk, please don't feel intimidated.
            We will have attendees of many different backgrounds and experience
            levels, and the speakers are no exception. Elm is a young language and
            this is its first conference, so everyone you meet will be an elm-conf
            newbie!
        </p>

        <p>
            We will be contacting all submitters with the results of the process by
            {{.Site.Params.cfp_notify}}. We won't leave you hanging!
