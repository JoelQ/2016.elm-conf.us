    <p>
        elm-conf is a one-day conference focusing on the Elm programming
        language and its libraries, colocated with <a
        href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/">StrangeLoop</a>. It aims to be a
        welcoming place for people worldwide to come together and learn about
        what is happening with the language and community, and to celebrate
        everything that makes Elm great.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are currently accepting <a href="">talk proposals</a>. The proposal
        period is open {{.Site.Params.cfp_start}} through
        {{.Site.Params.cfp_end}}, and tickets will go on sale after speakers are
        announced.

    <h2>Call for Speakers</h2>
    <p>
        If it's your first time proposing a talk, please don't feel intimidated.
        We will have attendees of many different backgrounds and experience
        levels, and the speakers are no exception. Elm is a young language and
        this is its first conference, so everyone you meet will be an elm-conf
        newbie!
    </p>

    <p>
        We will be contacting all submitters with the results of the process by
        {{.Site.Params.cfp_notify}}. We won't leave you hanging!
